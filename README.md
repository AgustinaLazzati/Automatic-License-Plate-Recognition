# 🚗 Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)

This repository contains an algorithm that automatically **detects** and **recognizes** license plates from vehicle images.

**Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)** is a computer vision task designed to **detect** and **read** vehicle license plates from images.  
It is widely used in **traffic monitoring**, **parking management**, and **security systems**.  

In this project, the focus is on **parking lot images**, where the goal is to design and compare multiple approaches for building a reliable system capable of detecting and recognizing license plates **accurately** and **consistently**.  

The main objectives include:
- Developing and evaluating **reproducible methods** for locating license plates and extracting their alphanumeric content.  
- Comparing **deep learning-based approaches** (e.g., YOLO models) with **traditional image processing techniques** to assess performance differences.  
- Understanding how each stage — from **preprocessing** to **recognition** — affects overall **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **generalization**.

This project explores **image processing**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision** strategies to analyze how different design decisions influence the effectiveness and reliability of a full ALPR pipeline.

Ultimately, this work addresses challenges related to:
- Handling **real-world image variations** (lighting, angle, and quality)
- Balancing **deep learning** and **traditional** methods
- Maintaining **consistent and reproducible** experimental setups

## ALPR Pipeline

The ALPR system operates in **four main stages**:

### 1️ Data Collection  
Analysis of provided (`real_plates.zip`) and custom-acquired images to ensure consistent **lighting**, **color**, and **camera angles**.
Also, data augmentation was implemented.

### 2️ Detection  
License plates are identified using:
- Traditional ML approach using morphological and gradient-based operations.
- **YOLOv5** and **YOLOv8** (COCO pre-trained)

- **LP-Detection Model** (YOLOv8-based, trained for license plates)

### 3️ Segmentation  
Plates are aligned and processed to extract individual characters using:
- **Contour**, **Blob** and **watershed** methods  
- **Preprocessing filters** for enhanced clarity

### 4️ Recognition  
Character recognition is achieved through:
- Feature descriptor extraction  
- **classifiers** – for digits and for letters  
- Final reconstruction of full license plate strings
