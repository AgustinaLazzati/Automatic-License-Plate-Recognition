# Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition
This is the repository that contains an algorithm that automatically detects and recognize license plates from vehicle images.


### Code Sections
- initial data data exploration at `DataExplorations`
- protocal testing and definition at `PROTOCOL`
- YOLO test code and models at `YOLO` 
- character segmentation pipelines at `CharacterSegmentation`
- character descriptors and classification at `CharacterDescriptors`


### Plots

- Most plots can be found at `plots`.

- Images used to test the YOLO model can be seen at `runs/detect`.

- The HSV plots used in the Fréchet + FFT pipeline can be seen at `hsv_plots`

- Plots related to the characters classification and validation are in the same folder as the code, `CharacterDescriptors`
